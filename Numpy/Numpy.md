## What Is NumPy?
- NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python.
- It supports arrays, matrices, and a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures efficiently. 
- NumPy is fundamental to scientific computing and is the foundation for many other data analysis and machine learning libraries, such as SciPy, pandas, and TensorFlow.

## Why Use NumPy?
<ol>
<li>Performance: NumPy is highly optimized for performance. Operations on NumPy arrays are implemented in C, which leads to significant speed improvements over Python lists.</li>
<li>Convenience: NumPy provides a wide range of functions for numerical operations, making it easier to perform complex mathematical computations.</li>
<li>Interoperability: NumPy arrays can be used with other libraries, such as SciPy, pandas, and scikit-learn, enhancing their capabilities.</li>
<li>Memory Efficiency: NumPy arrays consume less memory and provide a more efficient way to handle large datasets than Python lists.</li>
<li>Vectorization: NumPy enables vectorized operations, which allow efficient batch processing and avoid the need for explicit loops.</li>
