## Run python code on Windows
```
python file_name.py
Ex. python hello.py
```
<hr>

## Input & output:
- print(): This function is used to print the output.
- <b>Syntax : </b>
```
print("Hello World!!")
```
Syntax2: Inside the print() end the element with  '-'.
```
l1 = [1,2,3,4]
for x in l1:
    print(x , end"-")
```
Output:
1-2-3-4-
```
```
- input() : This function is used to take input from user.
- This function by defualt return the string.
- If we want to convert any other data type so we can do using type casting.
- Inside the input() we give the message that is display in ouput.
- <b> Syntax: </b>
```
x = input("Enter Element:)
```
```
x = int(input("Enter Element:")) <---- internal type - casting.
```
```
x = input("Enter Element:")
x = int(x) <---- External type - casting.
```
