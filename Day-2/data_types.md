# Python Data Types
- Python Data types are the classification or categorization of data items.
- It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.
- Since everything is an object in Python programming, Python data types are classes and variables are instances (objects) of these classes.

1. Numeric
2. Sequence Type(string,list,tuple)
3. Boolean
4. Set
5. Dictionary
6. Binary Types( memoryview, bytearray, bytes)

1. Numeric Data Types in Python
- Represents the data that has a numeric value.
  <ul>
    <li>an integer</li>
    <li>a floating number</li> 
    <li> a complex number</li>
  </ul>
- These values are defined as Python int, Python float, and Python complex classes in Python.
### Syntax
1. int data-type
-  positive or negative whole numbers (without fractions or decimals).
-  In Python, there is no limit to how long an integer value can be.
- <b> long int & sort int is not available in python3 but in python2 long is availabe.</b>
```
x = 12
y = 45333333333
```
2.float data-type
- This value is represented by the float class.
-  It is a real number with a floating-point representation.
-  It is specified by a decimal point.
```
x = 23.45677
```
3. Complex Numbers
- A complex number is represented by a complex class.
- It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j.
```
 For example – 2+3j
```
<b>Note – type() function is used to determine the type of Python data type. </b>
